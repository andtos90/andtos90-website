### Profile

Full Stack Developer with a strong focus on frontend technologies.
I’m currently working in Mostaza, a small and vibrant remote-friendly startup based in Padua (IT). In the last two years I improved my React and React Native skills and I’m happy to use them every day to build new projects and teach what I learned to other people and companies.

My second passion is teaching: in my free time I enjoy discussing about the techs I know and love. I've been a mentor of Coderdojo Padova for more than 4 years and I'm currently collaborating with various local organizations (both public and private).

### Experience

Mostaza
: _Software Developer_
**Oct 2004 - Now**
Web and mobile application development with React and React Native, backend development with Node.js.

As a software developer in a small startup I'm constantly facing new challenges not only related to coding but also about project management. I've been part and lead of different remote teams and I daily use most of the common tools to ease the communication and management in this scenario (Slack, Jira, Trello, Bitbucket, Github and so on).

Among all the project I've worked on I want to cite these:

- Emerson Connected:
  It's a complete solution to manage and optimise industrial refrigeration systems with bluetooth connectivity built by Emerson Electric Co. For the React Native mobile application I wrote the native and JS code to communicate over bluetooth with a specific serial protocol. I'm now the lead of the team that is also working on the cloud application (React and a serverless Node.js backend with various Azure services integration)

- MUVE Audioguide:
  For the Venice Civic Museums Foundation (MUVE) we built an audioguide mobile application with bluetooth beacons integration, MUVE comprehends 11 of the most important museums in Venice. As the Project Manager I've been involved in the whole development process, from the first functional analysis to the hardware deployment. The solution is composed by a mobile application written in React Native and a dedicated CMS (React and Node.js + Parse Server on top).

- Mediamarket employee evaluation:
  Mediamarket S.p.A was looking for a digital solution for their employees to evaluate other employee performance and we developed for them a complete custom solution based on their specific needs. It's one of the first projected I worked on and now, after 2 years of production, has thousands of compiled evaluation forms. I developed the web application with React and the backend with Node.js + Parse Server.

H-Farm Education
: _Laboratory Teacher_
**Jul 2016 - Aug 2017**
Within the Digital Summer Camp 2016 and 2017 I worked in various activities for kids between 11 and 18 years old. During the 7 weeks my main tasks were related to these topics:

- Robotics (assembling and programming an mBot robot)
- Python programming with Minecraft (use python to interact with the Minecraft world)
- Videogames and Virtual Reality (building a simple videogame in Unity 3D with the Google Cardboard SDK)
